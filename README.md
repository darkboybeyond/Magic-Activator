# Magic Activator – iCloud Activation Lock Bypass Tool (redsn0w Edition)

## Overview
Magic Activator is a **100% free Windows tool** that bypasses iCloud Activation Lock on iOS devices – no Apple ID or password needed.  
Spiritual successor of the legendary redsn0w, now supporting the latest iOS versions in 2025!

**Use ONLY on devices you own or have permission to unlock.**  
Bypassing iCloud violates Apple’s ToS – do it responsibly.

## Compatibility
| Category              | Supported                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **iOS Versions**      | iOS 17.0 → iOS 26.1 (all builds)<br>iOS 26.2 Beta 1 and below only       |
| **Devices**           | A8 → A18 (iPhone 6s → iPhone 17 series & compatible iPads)               |
| **Best regions**      | LL/A, XX/A (Americas)                                                    |
| **Partial regions**   | Europe, Asia, China (more community files = better support)              |
| **Platform**          | Windows 10/11 (64-bit)                                                   |

## How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)
1. Connect device via USB (DFU/Recovery mode)
2. Tool reads ECID, model, region & iOS build
3. Provide exact **MobileGestalt + supporting files** for your model/region/build  
   → Extract them in seconds with this shortcut:

4. Magic server generates a fake signed activation record
5. Record gets injected → device thinks it’s legitimately activated
6. OTA updates blocked automatically

**Success time:** 3–7 minutes  
**>10 min = abort & retry after cooldown**

## Features
- Completely FREE (no hidden paid version)
- No jailbreak required

## Current Limitations
- No full iCloud services (Drive, Find My, etc.)
